# Contemporary Issues In Data

# As companies accumulate more and more user data, analysts have to decide whether maximising the volume of data available is the most practical/useful approach. 

## Data Historians: The Plight of the Analyst (https://www.informationweek.com/big-data/data-historians-the-plight-of-the-analyst#)

# This article explores the evolution -specifically, the expansion- of the role of data analysts, due to the increasing volume and complexity of data being generated, new privacy regulations and technological advancements. As demands on data analysts are changing, the previously assumed premise that, when it comes to data collection, ‘more is more’, is being challenged. Fast analysis of data is vital, as advertising campaigns tend to be brief, to keep up with ever-evolving markets, however the massive amounts of data coupled with limitations in tools available to analysts, slows the analysis process down. This article was insightful for its explanation of the forces provoking the necessity for organizations to rethink their data strategies to extract the most actionable insights and ultimately obtain the best results.

## Ted Talk Tuesday: The Power of Big Data (https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/resources/article/ted-talk-tuesday-power-big-data/)

# This blog post provides a summary of a Ted talk by data analyst, Kenneth Cukier, in which he argued for the perspective that "big data is better data". I find the title a little misleading, as, where the term 'big data' often refers to the volume and complexity of information collected, Cukier emphasises he is referring to the accessibility and liquidity of data. As is evidenced in the previous/above article, volume of data may be antithetical to liquidity. Ultimately, he makes the argument that the greater the input to artifical intelligence, the better the learning. I do like his acknowledgement of the need for caution in adopting automation in data, as well as his call-to-action to the HR industry to plan for the inevitable worker redundancies that AI will cause.
